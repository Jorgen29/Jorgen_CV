            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a motivated and detail-oriented Bachelor of Science in
              Information Technology (BSIT) graduate, with a strong foundation
              in Computer System Servicing (CSS) gained during my Senior High
              School studies. I have a deep passion for using technology to
              solve real-world problems, particularly in the areas of web
              development, database management, and technical support.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my academic journey, I completed my OJT at PRECOCE as a web
              developer, where I designed databases and developed both front-end
              and back-end functionalities, systems and websites for client
              projects. I also served as an IT technician at PCKEN, where I
              performed computer repairs, software installations, and routine
              maintenance tasks. These experiences sharpened both my development
              and troubleshooting skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my academic and hands-on experience, I spent five
              years as an assistant manager at a Cignal TV dealership,
              overseeing operations, customer service, and technical
              installations. I also manage my own small computer shop, where I
              assist clients with various IT needs and business operations.
              These roles have helped me become adaptable, resourceful, and
              customer-oriented.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am committed to continuous learning and growth. Whether it's
              mastering new development frameworks, enhancing database systems,
              or delivering excellent support, I am always eager to contribute
              meaningfully to the organizations I work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies,
              upgrading computer systems, and sharing my knowledge with others.
